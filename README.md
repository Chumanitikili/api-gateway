# Welcome to My Project

Hi there! I'm excited to share my project with you. Here's everything you need to know to dive in and start working with it.

## Project Info

**URL**: https://api-gateway-qfz2.onrender.com


## What’s This Project Built With?

I chose some modern tools to make this project fast and flexible:
- Vite (for a zippy build process)
- TypeScript (to keep things typed and tidy)
- React (because components make life easier)
- shadcn-ui (for sleek, customizable UI)
- Tailwind CSS (to style things quickly)


That’s it! I’m really looking forward to seeing where this project goes. Feel free to explore, tweak, and make it your own. If you run into any questions, I’m just a message away!
